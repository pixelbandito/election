# Bug - figure out why names aren't saving on ballots

# Test not-logged in pages

* currentUser reference in Summary
  * ~Needs userProfiles api~
  * ~Needs user profile settings page~
  * Needs UI to prompt for a name
    * When you first sign in, takes you to profile edit screen.
    * You can have a screen name (globally unique) and maybe, in the future, a "real" name for private use.
    * If you have an account but not a name, everything redirects you to the profile edit screen.
    * Won't let you leave the profile edit screen without entering a non-falsey value and hitting save.
    * ~In the sign in dropdown menu, there's a profile edit view.~
* You can't vote in any polls, not even public ones
* Better log in prompts
